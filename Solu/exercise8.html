  	<p> Code is the language of the modern world. Whether it’s the app that brings emails to a mobile or the car that knows how many miles to go until refuelling. Any smart device needs code instructions to tell it how to operate and communicate with the outside world.

This modern language is so central to business life that the common mantra around technology experts is that today’s children will need to learn to code “or get coded”. It is not just hyperbole. AI-powered robots and programs are on course to be so sophisticated that as many as 400m to 800m jobs are predicted to be lost to the technology by 2030.

With such a dire warning over future job prospects, it is not a great surprise to hear that more workers are deciding to do the coding, rather than get coded. Today, there are 23 million coders in the world and that number will reach almost 28 million within five years time.
Even so, one in two UK-based digital business have been so frustrated by the struggle to recruit skilled programmers that they have launched their own Institute of Coding.

It is co-funded by government and the private sector, and operates in partnership with 25 universities. Its message is that everyday people can learn to programme computers and smart devices. This is not a job for “IT geeks” and it does not lead to endless shifts typing odd-looking numbers and letters and brackets into a keyboard.

Instead the career is promoted as being more about critical thinking and solving problems, which are skills that can open up a multitude of career paths to helping self-driving cars revolutionise global transportation.

The work can be rewarding but, not to sound too mercenary, so can the pay. Programmers earn an average of £52,500 across the UK and more typically an average of £72,500 in London. Contractors, who work without the security of a full-time job, can expect to average around £93,000.

With many future jobs expected to rely on coding skills, it is little surprise to see that education ministries across the world are beginning to push school to start teaching children how to code from a young age.

Within the EU, the UK stands out as one of the 15 countries that has embedded coding in secondary schools and one of nine pushing the skill at primary school. The researchers tracking the curriculum rollout identify two simple statistics as prompting the move. Not only do 90% of jobs require IT skills today, by 2020 there will be a predicted skills shortfall representing 800,000 skilled IT jobs across the EU.

There are many organisations trying to bring this message home to girls at school. According to the latest UK government figures, just 17% of tech employees are female. The Women In IT group believes much of this is due to stereotyping that can make the coding and computer programming industry appear to be the preserve of boys. But if the message that coding is for everyone, not just for boys, can be conveyed successfully, today’s children will be better placed to prosper in the AI-equipped world of the future.</p>

1914 translation by H. Rackham
"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC
"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."

1914 translation by H. Rackham
"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>

<p>The first computer program as such is generally thought to date back to 1843. It was in that year that the English mathematician and writer, Ada Lovelace published an algorithm, which calculated a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, designed to work on the Analytical Engine of her peer Charles Babbage. It was a complex start for a complex science and yet, over 100 years later, coding has developed a great deal. But will it continue to develop or has it seen it’s golden age? We look at the nature of coding and what the future holds for this ever-evolving technological process…

What is coding?

Put simply, coding is a way to teach a computer how to do something through specific language. In its earliest form, code looked very different to the way it looks today. Initially it was all about creating tiny holes in highly specific places on small cards, which computers would then be able to read. Then it moved onto being all zeros and ones, known as binary…

What does code look like now?

Today it looks more like standard English, though not entirely. As computer programming evolves to become more like English, it is becoming easier to learn and so more popular but also far less specialised. There’s a direct correlation between the amount that computer systems permeate our lives and the ease with which more of us can instruct them.

Currently there are a number of programming languages out there; JavaScript and HTML enable people to build websites, R and SAS are useful for handling statistics, engineers make use of AutoCAD programs, while Java, Python and C++ are more catch-all programmes used for a multitude of different tasks.

Is coding a useful qualification?

Put simply, yes. As computers become part of everyday life, it makes sense that companies are coming to rely on their own in-house computer programmers. A 2015 study found there were as many as seven million job openings in the US that required coding skills and that coding jobs are growing in number around 12% faster than the market average. This isn’t a trend that’s going away.

But isn’t coding just for the technology sector?

Not any more. It’s estimated that around half of all job openings for coders are in non-tech industries, including finance, manufacturing and healthcare. If you think about it, every company that uses computers, needs someone to instruct those computers.

Will coding always be a specialised skill then?

Not necessarily. As technology continues to develop at an incredible pace, we’ve seen enormous leaps in the way software companies are working. Put simply, they’re making coding easier, for everyone.

Bubble lets you design and host web applications without having to write code or hire a team of engineers. Zeroqode have created a one stop shop for codeless creation and Sparkster have built coding platforms that allow anyone to build software. Using a drag and drop approach that’s accessible to all of us and by defining logic in plain English, Sparkster are delivering the ability to code without the need for rigorous study or expensive training.

This type of software is pretty revolutionary within the industry. Giving everyone the opportunity to code — not just the highly paid 1% who are familiar with the cryptic language of coding — is bound to disrupt things. For some individuals keeping coding exclusive is hugely advantageous, but to the rest of us opening the technology out presents us with huge opportunities.

What is the future of coding?

While it used to be a specialised skill for mathematicians and IT graduates, coding has now become a core skill and salaries reflect how much that skill is valued by employers. Burning Glass, a US-based job market analytics firm, recently found that when a job requires coding skills the salary will reflect that, offering up to $22,000 more on average per annum.

Coding bootcamps are now popping up all over the place, with prospective job-seekers signing up in droves. And younger students will soon be on-board too. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is now launching a pilot scheme called Coding Across the Curriculum in New Hampshire. Their plan is to coach local teachers in teaching code in a bid to integrate computer science into the curriculum more effectively. This is just one example that illustrates how coding is entering the classroom. People in the know are investing in a future that prizes coding very highly.</p>
<P>The power of web design is becoming more and more definite with every passing year as society becomes increasingly dependent on the tools and platforms of the digital world. This fact is a key reason why big businesses are consistently buying their way deeper and deeper into the digital vein. Although it was meant to bring us closer together, it has its drawbacks.

We now have a ferociously desperate need for great software, but unfortunately, we are lacking equally great software developers who have the skills to build the software. 

The good news is that reinvention of the digital world that we all love and need is on the way.

Innovative dev tools give modern developers what they need to construct real-time features into applications that auto-update without the need to manually refresh your web browser. These tools are in effect removing the infrastructural burden from the product builders. Other blessings like the quasi-new open-source framework NativeScript gives developers the power to build single-codebase desktop and mobile apps, thus eliminating the need for multiple dev teams to work on mobile and desktop. NativeScript lets you maximize the web skills that you already possess. 

We are now reshaping the way we build web platforms. For example, React by Facebook and CSS-in-JS, also known as JSS, have made big waves in how we design apps. We are now sidestepping the norm of HTML as content, CSS as the look and JavaScript as the movement. The new development strategy of creating reusable components to solve a multitude of challenges is rapidly becoming the status quo. I personally champion change because change often breeds evolution and optimization. We all stand to benefit from having a faster and cheaper web to play with. Web development was once far too sluggish and often much too expensive to sustain. The web of yesterday required many people with many different skills, but the web of today has transferred power and confidence solely to the builder.

Our growth in web development is starting to shift the energy once spent on maintenance toward the customer. We now have more time to foster meaningful conversations that help us ask the questions that properly educate us on what customers' needs are. This gives us the ability to take advantage of the next web innovation phase involving the marriage of data and design. Businesses will embrace this new paradigm because they will benefit from data and analytically led user experiences that bring a layer of personalization to the customer.

Right now, we duplicate the same exact experience meant for a 70-year-old grandmother of six and a young woman fresh out of college who just landed a big New York ad agency job. Google currently crawls through our Gmail inboxes to discover the things that each person is interested in and more accurately serve them with offers that are natively specific to the very things they're intrigued by. Google has mastered this for ads, but when you step outside of the ad box, you come to notice that we fall annoyingly short. The crazy thing is that the technology infrastructure to do it the right way currently exists. We just need a little more time. It would be wise to expect the pending evolutionary shift to increasingly target employees more than consumers.

For example, I may be spending X dollars on X tools every month for my business, but as an employee, what if Google offered me relevant ads for alternative tools that were cheaper? That could save my business lots of dollars that could then be reinvested in Facebook and YouTube ads. Taking this a step further, what if these ads introduced me to relevant events that my fellow workmates were also interested in and asked me if I wanted to attend? This would help me foster deeper relationships within the organization and thus maximize my likelihood of staying at that company longer than I may have previously considered. Like consumers' relationships with products, employees are no longer joining companies for life, and employers are becoming more aggressive at poaching them. Consumers stick with products and brands they believe in just as employees want jobs that give them a purpose. Employee-targeted ads could be the first step toward learning more about the employee to serve them info that keeps them stimulated, engaged and saving. 

In regards to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, there will undoubtedly be much more movement toward remedying the fears around ethics, privacy and transparency. The focus up until now has been almost solely on development and implementation.

This has already begun with the release of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This has swiftly sparked the demand for privacy throughout the digital landscape. Any online destination that asks for data should present a visible and easily accessible policy with instant rights to withdraw that very data without loopholes and backdoor policies.

The web that we all grew up with is once again transforming into a new type of beast. I’m calling it now -- by 2025, more people will be accessing webpages through camera-based interfaces and voice than the traditional web browsers like Chrome and Firefox. I say this because Google is increasingly rebuilding itself into a multiplex of search, AI and virtual reality. They have displayed this product-building power through one of their latest products, Google Lens, which enables users to search the internet through their cameras much like an AI-powered, computer-vision reverse image search engine. 

The future of code and everything it consumes is bright. Just wait and see.</P>
